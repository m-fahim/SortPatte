###Problem Statement:
The user enters 10 random integers each within the range 0 – 25. These integers are depicted in two bar charts i.e. one vertical and the other horizontal. The bar charts should be synchronized with the values input by the user. As soon as the user updates the values of these 10 integers, the bar charts should be refreshed immediately to reflect this change.

The user then sorts these 10 integers using either bubble sort or insertion sort. The sorted list is depicted in the form of a vertical bar chart with numbers in ascending order. To adorn the output, the user can frame the vertical bar chart and/or add labels on the bars.
